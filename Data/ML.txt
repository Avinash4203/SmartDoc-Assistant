Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. It involves developing algorithms that can identify patterns, make predictions, and make decisions based on input data. The three primary types of machine learning are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, models are trained with labeled data. Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, finding hidden structures. Reinforcement learning involves agents learning through interaction with their environment, receiving feedback. Machine learning is widely used in applications like image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles.
